# DRPCAS

DRPCAS is an abbreviation that stands for **Discord Rich Presence Android Status**.

This repo has been tested on Windows, i'm not sure can run in Linux will be gonna work
atleast you have install packages on your Linux.

1. Android-SDK
2. AAPT

And yeah, this will be need your pc laptop or pc desktop whatever.
So anyway, make sure that you have to need to turn on **Developer mode** > USB Debugging on your android phone.

Having good for the test.
